# A CURRENCY CONVERTER 
## PYTHON INTERN AT CODE ALPHA
### TASK-2
> During my internship in Code Alpha I was to build a currency converter using python which can convert currencies. In this project, we will get real-time exchange rates for conversion. The user needs to select from and to currencies, like convert from USD to INR, now supply the value, and hit the convert button to get the desired results.
